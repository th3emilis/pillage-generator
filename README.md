Build pillager outposts anywhere in your world with the run of a single command. Pillage Generator adds various functions to the game to help you design your own pillager outpost from scratch quickly and easily. Now, go bring more life into your superflat worlds!

## Features

### Individual structures
Build your own pillager outpost, structure by structure.

## Usage

In the chat screen, type `/function pg/help` to get a list of all the available functions.

Once you have found the structure you want to generate, make sure you are positioned at the location where you want it to be placed. When choosing the location for the structure, keep in mind that they generate in the cardinal direction your character is facing and to the right. For example, if you are facing east, the structure will generate in the direction where both `X` and `Y` coordinate values increase.

Here are a few functions you can try before digging into all the available options:
- `/function pg/instant_pillager_outpost`: *Generate a prebuilt pillager outpost*
- `/function pg/watchtower`: *Generate a watchtower*
- `/function pg/populate`: *Summon pillagers and a pillager captain for your pillager outpost*

### Using on mobile
Many functions use long names that can get tedious to type on a mobile device after a while. For a better experience, you can use the add-on alongside [Advanchat](https://github.com/th3emilis/advanchat/releases/latest), which allows you to autocomplete commands and access previously run commands easily.
