Build pillager outposts anywhere in your world in the blink of an eye. Pillage Generator comes with all the functions you need to instantly place outposts, or, if youâ€™re feeling creative, to design your own from scratch with ease. Now go bring your superflat worlds to life!

## Features

## Usage

In the chat screen, type `/function pg/help` to get a list of all the available functions.

Once you have found the structure you want to generate, make sure you are standing where you want it to be placed. When selecting a location, keep in mind that structures generate diagonally to the right, in the cardinal direction your character is facing. For example, if you are facing east, the structure will generate toward positive `X` and `Y` coordinate values.

Here are a few functions to get you started:
- `/function pg/instant_pillager_outpost`: *Generate a prebuilt Pillager Outpost*
- `/function pg/watchtower`: *Generate a Watchtower*
- `/function pg/populate`: *Summon pillagers and a pillager captain for your Pillager Outpost*

### Using on mobile
Most functions follow the same structure naming scheme used internally by Minecraft. However, having to type complex function commands repeatedly on a mobile device becomes tedious very quickly. For a better experience, you can pair the add-on with [Advanchat](https://github.com/th3emilis/advanchat/releases/latest) to start autofilling and accessing previous functions effortlessly.
